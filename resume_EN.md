## Work Experience

### Career Summary

As an engineer, I have not only developed features but also considered which PoCs and new features would become competitive advantages for the service and contribute to KPI improvements such as revenue growth, working backwards from business strategies. As a leader of an ML team of 4-5 members, I led strategic planning and research roadmaps for updating internal product search functionality and new features, achieving quantitative results such as doubling search feature usage rates. In the Auto Generation team, I participated in 4 auto-generation logic projects over the course of one year, achieving service-level success rates in 3 of them. For example, I achieved 90%+ quality in banner ad image auto-generation for a certain pattern within approximately 2 months. I built high-speed experiment pipelines and annotation-based improvement workflows, balancing development speed with quality improvement. Also, as operating leader and member of DSOps training, I built a system where participating in training leads to actual projects in the field, contributing to organizational growth.
