## Personal Career Philosophy

Since childhood, I have loved drawing manga and illustrations so much that I once aspired to become a manga artist.<br>
With this background, I work with the desire to contribute to the creative and entertainment fields.<br>
My goal is to create products and works that bring joy to users.

## Work Experience

### Career Summary

As an engineer, I have not only developed features but also considered which PoCs and new features would become competitive advantages for the service and contribute to KPI improvements such as revenue growth, working backwards from business strategies. As a leader of an ML team of 4-5 members, I led strategic planning and research roadmaps for updating internal product search functionality and new features, achieving quantitative results such as doubling search feature usage rates. In the Auto Generation team, I participated in 4 auto-generation logic projects over the course of one year, achieving service-level success rates in 3 of them. For example, I achieved 90%+ quality in banner ad image auto-generation for a certain pattern within approximately 2 months. I built high-speed experiment pipelines and annotation-based improvement workflows, balancing development speed with quality improvement. Also, as operating leader and member of DSOps training, I built a system where participating in training leads to actual projects in the field, contributing to organizational growth.

### Apr 2022 ~ Mar 2025

**Organization**: CyberAgent / Kiwami AI Division / New Business Development Team  
**Position**: ML Engineer  
**Responsibilities**

**Strategic Planning**

- As a leader of the ML team, led strategic planning and roadmap creation for updating internal product search functionality and new features

**Search Feature Improvement**

- Formulated hypotheses from user usage history and improved functionality. Specifically, by adding multimodal search using images and text (e.g., searching with a material image + "premium feel"), improved the usability of image search and **successfully doubled search feature usage rates**. Also experimented and implemented logic to filter out poor-quality search results, **filtering out 40% of poor-quality search results** and improving the quality of search results displayed to users

**Backend Development**

- Also handled API development, mainly gaining experience in microservice development using Cloud Run

**MLOps**

- Under senior MLOps members, worked on building and operating basic inference servers and inference pipelines (using GKE, Triton, Cloud Batch, Apache Airflow on Cloud Composer, etc.). As a personal achievement, migrated the inference infrastructure from CPU to GPU. As a result, **achieved 6.28x faster inference speed compared to CPU**. Also reduced processing time by **62%** through preprocessing acceleration (including cache utilization)

**Cost Optimization**

- Cleaned up unused GKE and VMs, **contributing to approximately $2,500 monthly cost reduction**

**Organizational Contribution**

- As a leader of an ML team of 4-5 members, promoted PoC and production development of new features utilizing AI
- Also, as operating leader of DSOps training, planned new initiatives and built a system where participating in training leads to actual projects in the field (see [article][dsops-training] for details. It is written in Japanese.)

### Apr 2025 ~ Present

**Organization**: CyberAgent / Kiwami AI Division / Auto Generation Team  
**Position**: ML Engineer  
**Responsibilities**

**Ad Auto-Generation Logic Development**

- Participated in 4 auto-generation logic projects over the course of one year, achieving service-level success rates in 3 of them. Specifically, these projects involved consolidating ad patterns proposed by creators into requirements, translating them to implementation level, and confirming success rates through human annotation. Collaborated with 1-2 engineers and 1-2 PMs, promoting speed-focused development

**Project Results**

- (Since specific logic details are confidential, I will describe based on success rates) Among the successful projects, in the 1st project, collaborated with 5 engineers and **achieved 74% success rate quality in auto-generation within 2 months** (this was quite high accuracy before NanoBananaPro was released)
- In the 2nd project, worked with 2 engineers on banner ad image auto-generation for a certain pattern and **successfully developed auto-generation logic with 90% success rate quality within 3 months**. In this project, I mainly handled prompt tuning for image generation and image filtering, and implementation of generation pipelines
- In the 3rd project, worked with 2 engineers on banner ad image auto-generation for a certain pattern and **successfully developed auto-generation logic with 90%+ quality within 2 months**. In this project, I handled prompt tuning for image filtering and clear verbalization of annotation criteria. In all projects, collaborated with ad creators on requirements definition, rapidly iterated through experiment implementation, annotation requests, and feature improvement PDCA cycles, conducting speed-focused development. Also handled API implementation when necessary

**Organizational Contribution**

- As an operating member of DSOps training, realized a special lecture by Yuta Saito (Ph.D., Cornell University, Hanjuku Virtual Co., Ltd.). (I was the moderator for this [article][dsops-special-lecture].)

## Personal Projects

### Vocavisual: Linking words with visuals, beyond your native language.

This project aims to directly connect images with words being learned, without relying on one's native language.<br>
For example, when learning the word "cat," instead of translating it to "猫" (cat in Japanese) and memorizing it, the goal is to associate it with an image of a cat.<br>
By directly connecting images with words being learned without using one's native language as an intermediary, I believe this can promote deeper understanding.<br>
The project is being conducted on the following Instagram account:
